Chapter 3:

WR section:
add a figure of WR topology, make sure how to cite it and prove that You have the permissions

PTP section:
cite correctly the figure --- You saw it in many places, which of the articles should I cite, the original one, or any of them?

SPEC:
should I be more precise about the components?


FMC gateware, how to cite

WRTD:
implementation - maybe more details?

Communication:
zeroconf - the last part about the implementation of the zeroconf in DO should go to the next chapter

Maybe group the software somehow, but it could be difficult to separate it completely


MHz with space or without

The table \ref{tab:server:oscilloscope_model} presents three layer, hierarchical model of the system
It contains the following hierarchical model of the system, built from three layers, presented in the table \ref{tab:server:oscilloscope_model}:
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Implemented and foreseen applications forming part of the DO}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Users & Central unit  & Devices \\
\hline
GUI & Server & ADC \\
\textcolor{gray}{PMU} &   & \textcolor{gray}{TDC} \\
 &  & \textcolor{gray}{FD} \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{tablenotes}
  \item The gray elements are not implemented.
  \end{tablenotes}
\label{tab:server:oscilloscope_model}
\end{table}

Maybe replace the name GUI with the User and ADC with the Device to make it more generic and have the possibility of adding the PMU.
