* General remarks
- Letter size
- PDF properties
- date/year on title page
- purpose on title page
- do not put commas at the end of items in bullet lists
- communicate the <x> -> communication between the <x>
- nodes are not "communicated with each other", they "communicate with each other"
- One figure is a schematic, not "schematics". Also, schematic is rarely used. Instead, we use
  "(block) diagram", "map", "figure",...
- LXI, not "the LXI" (but still, "the LXI standard" because "the" refers in this case to the
  "standard")
- I miss a "vision", a description of the final use scenario, which would explain also the name of
  the project: you open the program, you see a list of signals that you can connect to your scope,
  you select the trigger source (external or one of the channels), put in acquisition parameters and
  you get the signals on your screen, perfectly corelated, even though they are kilometers away.

* 1
- no text
** 1.1
- power grids are not scientific installations
- missing link between installations and ACQ
- you do not explain Fig1.1
- Fig1.1 might be wrong. At least it's not clear, cause I see no "problem".
- distributed data -> distributed signals
- OASIS Anastasiya
  + better talk about trigger distribution in OASIS, not OASIS in total
  + FGCs, digital sources
  + cannot trigger bidirectionaly
  + OASIS and WRTD in near future
- LXI does not belong to this list, as it is, it is not a large-scale distributed system
  + even then, you should be talking about the extended functions of LXI, not the whole standard
- So, why WRTD is not on the list?
- I would actually skip the list completely here and discuss in general about the shortcomings, leaving
  the presentation to the next chapter.
- specialised crates?
- it is not mentioned anywhere that this is a proof of concept, a demonstrator
** 1.2
- what timestamps?!?
** 1.3
- things falling out of the sky, example PMU

* 2
- do not start by restating 1
- LXI is not a system
** 2.1
- you start by describing IVI, not LXI
** 2.2
- what are the LHC instabilities, why LIST was needed?

* 3
- Fix the title
- I think you should rewrite it, it almost does not make sense
** 3.1
- Do not call it Sync.Eth.
- 3.1.2 feels a bit short, maybe remove both 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 and say a few things about what WR
  provides without trying to explain how
** 3.2
- do we care about the state machine of the ADC gw?
** 3.3
- 3.3.2: what 125MHz clock? schematics? anticipated devices? I think you should rewrite it
- 3.3.3: do we care about the API of WRTD? Why don't you present the API of python-zeroconf as well?
- 3.3.4: fixed font for code. Do we care about code examples? I1, O1 is the first channel
- 3.3.5: MockTurtle framework falls out of the sky. Do we care about WRTD implementation and soft-CPUs?
** 3.4
- You are supposed to be presenting what you used to solve your problem. Instead you present other
  things as well.
- How did you decide to use RPC for communication? What other alternatives did you consider?
- 3.4.1: Other solutions apart from central unit approach? why did you choose it? zeroconf = LXI.
- 3.4.2: zeroMQ falls out of the sky
- 3.4.3: At this section level I was expecting to read about enumeration, communication,
  readout. This looks like it should be 3.4.2.1.
- 3.4.4: Same as above.
- So what do we use for communication and data retrieval? I finished section 3.4 and I could not answer that.

* 4
- This is a good chapter introduction!
** 4.1
  - discuss the limitation of ADC buffer size
** 4.2
  - why the ADC app needs to be light?
** 4.3
  - this list does not match the list in 3.4
  - 4.3.1: why make the DO compatible with LXI?
  - 4.3.2: RPC, not "the RPC" (but, "the RPC server"). Nested RPC calls? Why was the statement wrong?
  - 4.3.3: RPC calls = Remote Procedure Call calls
  - 4.3.3: we already know that RPC is not used for new device detection and acquisitions
* 5
** 5.1
- in Figure 5.1, the GUI is not hardware, and the server is not present
** 5.2
- the "telling a story" style does fit better in a report, not a thesis
- the "i designed without a plan first" does not reflect well on you
- why async messages allow for optimisation?
- dictionaries, what dictionaries? I know nothing about dictionaries :)
** 5.3
- 5.3.2: don't be apologetic about the intuitiveness. It is intuitive and the instructions can fit
  in a single A4 page, including pictures.
- 5.3.2: how does the general architecture affect the functionality of the GUI?
- 5.3.2: Figure 5.5 is not referenced anywhere, you point instead to Fig 5.6 which is for the ADC.
- 5.3.4: don't "teach" ("the most important elements...")
** 5.5
- Do you feel you need to justify the development time of DO? If not, don't. Always prefer to be
  positive.
** 5.6
- There it is again! WTF is a PMU? You make it sound like it is the most natural application of DO.
- 5.6.1: you do not reference fig 5.10, instead you double ref 5.9
- It is a bit late here when you clearly state what you used. Perhaps you should do it earlier and
  hint/point to the measurement results presented here.
- 5.6.2: and -> end, subsection -> Section
- in all plots/figures, post-samples -> number of samples
** 5.7
- Also WR itself is not calibrated
- WR is 1ns accurate, not precise

* Overall impression
If I were your professor (which I'm not), I wouldn't be satisfied with this document. Reading
through it I got two main impressions:
  1. That you did not want to write it. You rush through explanations, you choose some random topics
     that you expand (to fill pages), others that you do not expand at all.
  2. That you perhaps never read it yourself, beginning to end, word after word, pausing to think
     what you just read and whether it makes sense.
All in all, it feels like a document written out of obligation, not because you wanted to explain to
others what you did. As such, it believe that it does not respect the reader.
